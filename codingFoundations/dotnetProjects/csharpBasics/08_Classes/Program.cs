//* Classes (Reference Type)

//* Main component of programe
//* When we define a class, we can define the members it holds

//* This is just the definition, JUST A BLUEPRINT

//* The idea is to have multiple objects talking to one another OOP (Object oriented programming)

//* making our first obj

//todo: once you've made a class, we can make 'copies' of that class
//todo: 2. Add reference to _08_Classes (namespace)  [ctrl + .]
Donut doug = new Donut();

System.Console.WriteLine(doug);  //_08_Classes.Donut -> this is just the reference location 


//todo: 1. Ex: make a class
namespace _08_Classes
{
    //our class: (15-19)
    public class Donut
    {

    }
}
